## Getting Started
Once you open the app you will be brought to the home page. Here you can view the active class (the class you should be in), the lunch for the day, and a list of plans you have scheduled for the day. You will also notice at the top a greeting (good morning etc.), if you would like to change your name you can simply press the menu button in the top left of the home page and then select name. In the options menu you can also suggest app ideas, and report any bugs. By using the bottom navigation you can switch to the three other pages. The second page is a planner. Here you can simply press the blue + button in the bottom right to begin adding a new event. Simply select the date, choose a name of the event, and optionally add a description. Then press the Add button, and now you have a new event. Moving onto the third page, the classes, you can add your schedule in order, by pressing the blue + button in the bottom right corner. This will allow you to enter in the class name and optionally the room number. Then simply press the Add button, and you will see the new class appear. The times of the classes are automatically assigned which allows you to simply input the classes in the correct order. If you would like to make a new class schedule you can simply press the Clear button at the top right corner of the page. The last page to learn how to use is the socials page. Here you can find easy access to the CCHS Instgram, Twitter, and even the website.
